# SOLID Principles

## Single Responsibility

A class should have one and only one reason to change. Keep the class on a focused role/job.

## Open-Closed

Classes, Modules, Functions should be open for extension but closed for modification. Should be able to expand the capabilities of your types without having to alter them

## Liskov Substitution

Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering correctness.

## Interface Segregation

Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces they do not use. Break a protocol into multiple smaller ones. So parts of the app can implement the ones that are relevant to them

## Dependency Inversion

Depend on abstractions not concerete. Program to a protocol not the specific implementation.
